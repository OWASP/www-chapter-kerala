Being the Operating System with the largest user-base, the threat landscape for Android applications cannot often be ignored. While Android OS is being used in a wide variety of devices from smart watches to TVs, a large chunk of its user-base is concentrated to mobile phones. Popular services which were offered over web are also trying constantly to adapt themselves for the mobile environment. This raises a few important questions to Information Security enthusiasts.

How similar or how different are the threats related to Android applications?

How can we perform penetration tests on an Android application?

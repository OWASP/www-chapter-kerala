### Abstract

Human risk is real, and information and cybersecurity awareness trainings are NOT assuring and adequate. In this webinar, I intend to touch upon, with walk-through, of an attempt to draw and pre-empt assurances with a subjective yet out-of-box proposition to influence and get-influenced while not-endorsing in entirety the myopic compliance-focused de-facto industry approach.
